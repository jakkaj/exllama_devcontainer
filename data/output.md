The document discusses an experiment that compares three methods for image matching using the Image Matching Challenge 20 dataset. It evaluates LightGlu, SuperPoint, DISK in combination with various numbers of images and thresholds on both stereo track and multi-view track. The results show that LightGlu performs better than SuperPoint and significantly reduces the matching time while improving over other combinations when used with DISK. To ensure fair comparisons, the performance improvements are excluded from all experiments except where explicitly stated. Qualitative results are shown in figures 8 and 9, which illustrate how LightGlu discards unmatched points and its early stopping mechanism on easy/medium/hard pairs. OpenCV with USAC MAGSAC is used for robust homography estimation, and the threshold is tuned separately for each method. This decision was made because previous works fix the RANSAC parameters but it argued that this approach minimizes variations introduced by hyperparameters for fair and representative evaluations.
