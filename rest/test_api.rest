  "prompt": "TEXT: Title is the debut EP by American singer-songwriter Meghan Trainor. Kevin Kadish produced all of its songs and wrote them with Trainor. The two conceived the EP shortly after Trainor signed with Epic Records in 2014. The label released it on September 9, 2014, and replaced it with a pre-order for Trainor's 2015 debut major-label studio album of the same name the following month.\n\nMusically, Title comprises songs inspired by 1950s doo-wop that lie between modern R&B and melodic pop. The EP has a lyrical theme of commitment and staying true to oneself, which Trainor hoped would empower women. It includes Trainor's debut single, \"All About That Bass\", which was released on June 30, 2014, and reached number one in 58 countries with worldwide sales of 11 million units.\n\nTitle garnered mixed reviews from critics, who thought its tracks had potential for commercial success but considered the lyrics too repetitive and questioned Trainor's musicality. The EP debuted at number 15 on the Billboard 200 and sold 171,000 copies in the United States. It also entered charts in Canada and Denmark. Trainor promoted Title by performing \"All About That Bass\" on various television shows, and its title track at other venues. She included all tracks from the EP on the set lists of her 2015 concert tours That Bass Tour and MTrain Tour.\n\nBackground and development\nMeghan Trainor developed an early interest in music and started singing at age six. After her father encouraged her to pursue her musical interests, she independently released three albums from material she had written, recorded, performed, and produced, between the ages 15 and 17. These included Trainor's eponymous 2009 release, and her 2010 albums I'll Sing with You and Only 17.[1] She introduced herself to former NRBQ member Al Anderson at a music conference in Nashville.[2] Impressed by Trainor's songwriting, he referred her to his publisher Carla Wallace of music publishing firm Big Yellow Dog Music.[1][2] Though Trainor had been offered a full scholarship to the Berklee College of Music, she decided to pursue her songwriting career and signed with Big Yellow Dog in 2012.[3][4]\n\nAmerican songwriter Kevin Kadish met Trainor in June 2013 at Wallace's request. He liked Trainor's voice and felt a strong songwriting affinity with her due to their mutual love of pop music from the 1950s and 1960s.[5][6] Disenchanted with the electronic dance music that populated Top 40 radio, he had wished to create a \"'50s-sounding record of doo-wop-inspired pop\" for three years, but could not find any artist that shared his interest.[7][8] Trainor, who had been introduced to doo-wop by her father at a young age, found it to be \"the catchiest stuff\" and wanted to create something reminiscent of The Chordettes's 1958 single \"Lollipop\".[9] Kadish shared his idea with Trainor after the two bonded over Jimmy Soul's 1963 song \"If You Wanna Be Happy\", and they decided to create an extended play (EP) with the same sound, \"just for fun\".[7][8] They completed three songs before Kadish started producing a rock album for the rest of the year.[7] Trainor moved to Nashville in November 2013 and they co-wrote the song \"All About That Bass\", pitching it to different record labels, all of which rejected it due to its doo-wop pop sound as synth-pop was more popular at the time.[1][4][10] USER: Summarize the text\nASSISTANT: "
